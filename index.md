### Joviality

Joviality delivers psychotherapy to patients suffering from serious/terminal illnesses with the help of VR. It is broken up into modules with the intent to teach users about the importance of emotional and mental wellbeing. This is a highly inter disciplinary project between software engineers, artists and sociologists. I have led the development of the software as well as developing pipelines that easily allow our team to work effectively. One of the cool features of our software is a completely gazed based interaction system to ensure easy access to patients who might be tethered to a hospital bed. We are also working on developing realistic non playable characters to guide the user through the curriculum.

### Neonatal VR

I lead the development of a virtual reality software to train common procedures performed on neonates. One of those porceudres is umbilical venous catheterization (UVC). UVC is an emmergent procedure that involves inserting a catheter into a newborns umbilical stump through the umbilical vein. I take educational content from subject matter experts (neonatologists) and convert that to VR content. We develop realistic interactions to simulate the procedure to allow users to learn/review the steps of the procedure in an immersive manner. The demonstration below is of the working prototype for this software. We hope to continue developing this prototype and to run a study to understand the efficacy of the software in teaching this content.

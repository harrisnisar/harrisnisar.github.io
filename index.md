### Virtual Reality (VR) Projects

<!-- [Project 1 Title](/sample_page) -->

#### Joviality

Joviality delivers psychotherapy to patients suffering from serious/terminal illnesses with the help of VR. It is broken up into modules with the intent to teach users about the importance of emotional and mental wellbeing. This is a highly inter disciplinary project between software engineers, artists and sociologists. I have led the development of the software as well as developing pipelines that easily allow our team to work effectively. One of the cool features of our software is a completely gazed based interaction system to ensure easy access to patients who might be tethered to a hospital bed. We are also working on developing realistic non playable characters to guide the user through the curriculum.
